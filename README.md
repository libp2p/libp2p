libp2p is a modular networking framework bundled together as a full stack of protocols for peer-to-peer systems.

libp2p is the product of a long and arduous quest into the internet's network stack and all of the plentiful 
peer-to-peer protocols of the past. Building large-scale peer-to-peer systems have been complex and challenging 
in the last fifteen years, and libp2p is a way to fix that. It is a "network stack" -- a protocol suite -- that 
cleanly separates concerns and enables sophisticated applications to only use the protocols they need without 
giving up interoperability and upgradeability. libp2p grew out of IPFS but is built so that many people can use 
it for many different projects.
