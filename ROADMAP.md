# CACHED MILESTONES (for later re-evaluation)

## Milestone - Developer Experience

> Summary: Get libp2p into a state that is super easy to use and understand.

##@ Tasks

- [ ] Examples
  - [ ] How to use js-libp2p (dial, multi transport, stream muxing, identify, protocol multiplexing)
  - [ ] How to use go-libp2p (everything js-libp2p + DHT)
- [ ] Spec
  - [ ] Move spec to the libp2p org
  - [ ] Revisit and improve
- [ ] interface-libp2p
  - [ ] Make js-libp2p-ipfs and js-libp2p-ipfs-browser use it
  - [ ] Create js-libp2p, a base class that other libp2p builds can reuse
- [ ] make go-libp2p have a top level, easy to use package
- [ ] add examples for each of the go-libp2p- repos

### Notes `NA`

### Expected date of completion: `NA`

----------------------------------------------------------------

## Milestone - Move DHT to use IPRS

> Summary: Currently our records are simple protobufs that get stored in the datastore. With this milestone, any record (provider or IPNS) will be a full IPLD object that follows the IPRS spec.

### Tasks

- [ ] Technical Discussion: Decide if whether we should support two types of records or simply create another universe of the DHT
- [ ] Migrate go-ipfs to use IPRS
- [ ] js-libp2p-dht (also known as dht legacy)

### Notes `NA`

### Expected date of completion: `NA`

----------------------------------------------------------------

## Milestone - Break DHT into Peer Routing and Content Routing

> Summary: `NA`

### Tasks

- [ ] Technical Discussion: Revisit proposed spec

### Notes

This milestone is still very green, however something we know for sure we want to do.

### Expected date of completion: `NA`

----------------------------------------------------------------

## Milestone - Packet Switching / Overlay Network

> Summary: The packet switched overlay network

### Tasks

- [ ] Packet switch implemented and integrated into go-ipfs
  - https://github.com/ipfs/notes/issues/143

### Dependencies

- [ ] Multigram specced and implemented in Golang
  - https://github.com/multiformats/multigram

### Notes

The overlay network will not have any multi-hop routing for now.
We only introduce the packet switch and continue being a direct single-hop network.

### Expected date of completion: ``

## Milestone - Improve Connectivity of go-libp2p/go-ipfs
